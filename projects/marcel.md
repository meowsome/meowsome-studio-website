short_description: A simple and personable bot for your Discord server that adds both convenience and fun
description: Starting out as an introductory project to Node.js and Discord.js with the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://bucketmuncher.meowso.me">a friend</a>, Marcel soon evolved into a bigger project. Marcel is a Discord bot built using the Discord.js module. It has many different features, including fact searching using the Wolfram|Alpha API, playing music using the YouTube API, showing user information, displaying weather, fun cosmetic features such as flipping a coin and a magic 8-ball, and more. It is currently in over 60 Discord servers.<br><br>Marcel's website is built using plain HTML, CSS, and jQuery. It loads all pages when the website is visited, allowing for instant switching between pages. It also displays live statistics of the status of the bot as well as the number of Discord users and servers the bot has access to.
